## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Playrockpaperscissors's target users are:
* Aged 18-80
* Past/future online games enthusiasts
* People interested in simple intercative online games 
* Have an interest in visiting online games events

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-play intercative online games
* Beautiful webpage that provide inspiration and make the game look desirable
* Helpful guidance on how to play the game
* Recommendations for other future online games 

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with travel guides.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Naav-bar , to name the  game and provide a reset function on the page
- Pictures section for displaying the various choices. 
- Buttons to click to make choices
- Information, as to who won the game
- Score on each attempt of the game


### **Structure** 

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily see the name of the game. I chose the following order for the information 'Home > Name of the game > Pictures > Buttons to make the choices > Display scores and choices ', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. There is an intercative online game providing entertainment to the user. the design is such that the  users will be able to find these key bits of information quickly. 

### **Skeleton**


Whilst building the website I felt that it should be simple and interactive and it should have obvious as to how to play the game, for this reason, I opted to install the  buttons with the choice names on them and made it to fit at the centre of the web page on all devices and not just the mobile. This allows for user's to have focused information without taking mush time; I felt giving the user this control would provide a positive user experience. 

I also decided to change my photos to seperate tabs as I felt it looked cleaner and I preferred this method of interaction, it also allowed for better responsiveness and the images looked better on larger screens.

### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around blue and  black  as these colours remind me of the sky & being amongst friends; I want the users of this website to be transported to their memories of welbeing and calm  and fun believe these colours will help to do this. I paired these with a lighter off-white to allow for appropriate contrast. 


## The site structure:

The site has three sections on the landing page that respond to different choices on the same page that can also be seen by scrolling down.
The sections are:
- Navigation Bar with Game title
- Pictures in depicting Choices -Rock Paper Scissors
- Buttons with Choices - Rock Paper Scissors
- Displays Computer Choice
- Displays User Choice
- Displays Result
- Displays Score


## Features 

  This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the page is divided into three sections . A dark colour background has been used so as to provide good contrast ratio and the text is off-white. All of the headings use the font Lato and the body text is sanserif, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design.

### Unfixed Bugs

    the gitpod bug could not be dealt with but ended up wasting a lot of my time which in turn resulted in alot of things that coud not be added to the project. I wish they figure it  out. The commits that are done locally should not belost just because you close your workspace. 

    I lost all my work again in this project as i had created an alternate repository where I was going to add wetahr app to the aplication but Since the laptop crashed I lost all work saved on my dektop which was not pushed.

    In order to get trid of the virus or bug I had to reinstall my OS.
